description = "ToneTint is a Python package that provides an intuitive way to perform sentiment analysis on text data and visualize the results. It splits the input text into manageable chunks, analyzes each chunk using a pre-trained sentiment analysis model, and highlights the text with background colors corresponding to the sentiment. Additionally, it displays tooltips with detailed sentiment scores when hovering over each text chunk."
